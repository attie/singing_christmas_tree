singing_christmas_tree
======================

A simple singing Christmas Tree, using Arduino, for after school clubs.
This was made to run on an Arduino Uno.

The project involves customising a laser-cut christmas tree silhouette with LEDs, and connecting a piezo buzzer.

You can see a couple of example performances here:
